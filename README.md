# tempograph

`tempograph` comes in parts:

- a dense text notation based on ffmpeg's filtergraph (`name=value:any_key=value`) to describe the tempo of a song (constant or variable)

- a software library which can query information about notated tempo (x beat's time, total beat count at x time, total time at x beats...) using analytical evaluation of the notation as an integral

- a graphical interface to make tempo notation easy
